# 💻 ML-Projects Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning and Data Science projects** demonstrating practical skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, classification, regression, and clustering.

---

## 🚀 Overview

These projects cover:

- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization  
- Feature Engineering & Selection  
- Supervised Learning: Classification & Regression  
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering  
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, Confusion Matrix, Silhouette Score  

Each project is designed to be **reproducible**, with a clear structure and documentation to understand the workflow from raw data to actionable insights.
