# 🏍️ Motorcycle Price Prediction App

A machine learning-powered web application built with **Streamlit** to predict the selling price of motorcycles based on their specifications.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to:

* Upload their own motorcycle dataset
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Train multiple machine learning models
* Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
* Predict motorcycle prices based on input features

The goal is to provide a **data-driven tool** for buyers and sellers to estimate fair motorcycle prices.
